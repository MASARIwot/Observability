# I need a docker-compose.yml that will have  jaegertracing/all-in-one ,  prom/prometheus and otel/opentelemetry-collecto
# where opentelemetry-collecto collect traces and send it to jaeger, metrics to prometheus and jaeger read metrics from prometheus
# also I will need config files for all of them
# thank you
